Project Title: Identification of pathogenic disease-associated short tandem repeats (STRs) in clinical samples

## Tools

The analysis for this project employed [ExpansionHunter](https://github.com/Illumina/ExpansionHunter), [REViewer](https://github.com/Illumina/REViewer) and [STRipy Database Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/andreassh/stripy-pipeline) to call and annotate Short Tandem Repeats (STRs).

**ExpansionHunter** was used to identify Short Tandem Repeats (STR), **REViewer** to visualise the alignment of the STR and the **STRIpy pipeline** to compare the identified STRs to the STRIpy Database to see the effect of the STRs on the associated diseases.

## Major Results
